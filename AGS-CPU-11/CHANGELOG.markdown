## [Unreleased]

## Rev C - 2021-07-26

### Fixed

- Location of pull-up resistor R7. It's on the SoC side *before* the series resistor array RA1
- Capacitor C2 value. 34pF is not a standard value, and apparently AGB uses the exactly same circuit and 33pF -> most likely it's 33pF in AGS too.

## Rev B - 2021-03-03

### Added

- Proper symbol for transformer T1

### Fixed

- Incorrect pinout of transistor Q1

## Rev A - 2020-10-16

### Added

- Initial release
